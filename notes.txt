Simple vs Easy
Simple - not connected with anything, an objective notion
Easy - always relative, easy for whom? in what context?

example of simple = a cup
example of easy = speaking japanese

Complecting
to make something complex; to combine things

a studfinder tool is easy to use, complected with drywall and studs

the artifact is the thing 
construct = "programmer convenience"
we should care about the result of what we're producing, not on how we're producing it

Human Complexity Limitations
our ability to put context in our head is fundamentally limited to small chunks at a time
juggler analogy

you can create a mountain of complexity in a weekend!
programs consist of thousands of pieces of interconnected logic
Are your requirements getting simpler or more complex?
who has customers that say "can you have it do less in the next version?"


Values vs References
a value is the data, the real thing
values don't change, you don't change one value into another value, you've just created a new value
